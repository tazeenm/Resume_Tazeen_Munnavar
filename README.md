# Introduction!

Hello, I am Tazeen Munnavar, a graduate Management Information Systems student at The Eller College of Management.

I believe that passion, dedication and hard work is the key to achieving any goal in life. With these components coupled with perseverance, I have achieved my first milestone of pursuing my Master's in Management Information Systems - a field which blends technology with business from the Eller College of Management.

Fundamentals of Computing, taught in our freshman year was my first experience into this stupendous kingdom of technology. Ever since then, I have been fascinated by this sphere and determined to excel in it. With the overwhelming amount of data available today, I feel compelled to experiment, and derive meaningful insights from it. I have developed a strong interest in working with data to uncover business insights and make business-critical decisions. I am a highly organized individual, passionate about collaborating with technology and business leaders to solve challenges by prioritizing customer requirements. 

I'm interested in the following:
- Business Intelligence Engineer
- Product Manager
- Data Engineer/Analyst
- Business Analyst
